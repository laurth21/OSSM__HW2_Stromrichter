M3_Stromrichter.py is providing functions to calculate the most important 
design elements of an M3 inverter for a solar energy grid feed-in. It includes
calculating the design of a Dy transformer for which the transformer ratio is required.
For the inverter the control angle alpha for firing the thyristors at the operating 
point of the PV system is calculated and the system is evaluated by calculating the 
total power factor including calculation of the grid current effective value.
